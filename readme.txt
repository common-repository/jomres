Jomres is a commission-free, responsive, Open Source multi-vendor, multi-language, multi-property online booking plugin for accommodation, rentals and tours used by thousands of businesses worldwide to manage their properties and reservations. You can create an unlimited number of booking websites, accessible to customers on any device, in any language.

From basic features like secure frontend property administration, comprehensive and flexible [search features](http://www.jomres.net/manual/site-managers-guide-2/402-search-widgets), [iCal import and export](http://www.jomres.net/manual/property-managers-guide-2/41-your-toolbar/bookings/328-jomres-ical), through to powerful developer tools such as its built-in [REST API](http://www.jomres.net/manual/developers-guide-2/90-channel-management-framework) and  [Webhooks](http://www.jomres.net/manual/developers-guide-2/64-webhooks) functionality, there's something here for everybody. Whether you are looking for a booking engine for a single property site, or a complete portal, Jomres is where it's at.


Jomres is created and maintained by me, Vince Wooll. I am not a designer or a marketer, I'm a software engineer who believes that there's still a place for the solo developer in today's internet. I think of Jomres as less a booking engine and more a toolkit, with a set of tools that my users can use to build their own unique online websites. Jomres follows that line of thinking with it's strong emphasis on giving you, the user, the [information and tools](http://www.jomres.net/documentation/) you need to create something amazing.

== What's new? ==

= Bootstrap no longer required =

Jomres can now be run on non-Bootstrap themes. This means that you can use Jomres on any theme, not just Bootstrap themes. If you're using a Bootstrap theme, you can still use the Bootstrap version of Jomres, but you don't have to.


== Demos ==

[See the Portal Demo here - a variety of bookable items, multiple owners](http://wordpress-portal.jomres.net/)

License holders can download the "QuickStart" zip file that enables you to deploy a full installation of WordPress with everything already set up to exactly match the Demo. You can be up-and-running, with a fully-featured booking website that looks terrific, within minutes.

== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress dashboard, go to Plugins > Add New

2. Search for "Jomres"

3. Click Install and activate the plugin. Note, Jomres Core is actually downloaded during activation. As Jomres is pretty big, this can take a minute or more on a slow connection. Please be patient, it's worth the wait.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Jomres free? =

= Is there a manual? =
